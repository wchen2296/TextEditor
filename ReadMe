# Text Editor

This is a simple text editor program implemented in C++. It allows you to create, modify, and manipulate text files through a command-line interface.

## Features

- Create a new text file
- Add text to an existing file
- Read the contents of a file
- Empty the contents of a file
- Delete a file
- Copy the contents of one file to another

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., g++).
2. Clone this repository or download the source code files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
4. Compile the code using the following command:
    ```
    g++ main.cpp -o text_editor
    ```
5. Run the program by executing the generated executable:
    ```
    ./text_editor
    ```

## Usage

Once the program is running, a menu will be displayed with various options. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform different operations on text files.

Note: The program assumes that the text files have the `.txt` extension. When entering a file name, you don't need to include the extension explicitly.

## Error Handling

The program includes basic error handling to handle various scenarios such as invalid user input, file not found, and file opening errors. If an error occurs, an appropriate error message will be displayed to the user.
